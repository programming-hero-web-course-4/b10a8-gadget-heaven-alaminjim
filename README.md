2. Here is the list of React fundamental concepts used in the project:

Components: React applications are built using components, which are reusable, self-contained units of code that define how the UI should appear.
Props: Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
State: State is used to manage dynamic data within a component. It allows components to respond to user inputs, server responses, or other events.
Event Handling: React provides an event-handling system to capture user interactions (like clicks, inputs, etc.) and trigger specific actions.
React Router: React Router enables navigation between different components or pages in a React application.
useState Hook: This is a function that allows you to add state to functional components.
useEffect Hook: The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or updating the DOM.
Conditional Rendering: React allows rendering different UI elements or components based on conditions (e.g., if a product exists or if the user is logged in).
Lists and Keys: React supports rendering lists of data dynamically, and keys are used to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

3.I have used LocalStorage to manage data in the project. LocalStorage is used for storing data persistently in the browser, allowing the information (such as cart and wishlist) to be retained even after a page refresh or when the browser is closed and reopened.

4.Here are 5 features of your website that you can mention in the documentation:

        1.Product Display: The website showcases a variety of gadgets, such as computers, phones, smartwatches, and more, in an easy-to-navigate grid layout with detailed product cards.

        2.Product Details Page: Each product has a dedicated details page displaying complete information, including images, price, specifications, and a "Add to Cart" and "Add to Wishlist" button.

        3.Cart: Users can add products to the shopping cart, view the total price, and have the ability to sort items by price in descending order.

        4.Wishlist: Users can add items to their wishlist and easily view them later. The wishlist prevents duplicates by disabling the "Add to Wishlist" button once an item has been added.

        5.LocalStorage: The cart and wishlist data are stored using LocalStorage, ensuring that user selections are preserved even after page reloads or when the website is closed and reopened.
